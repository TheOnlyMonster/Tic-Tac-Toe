# Tic-Tac-Toe
 This is a full Tic Tac Toe game using OOP and CPP
 
I created this project to practise some OOP concepts that I learned from college. You can play the game either locally or against AI player that I created. Computer player can not lose because I used minmax algorithm. In other words, the AI player can either win or draw. Also, I created UML as shown below that decribe the realationships between classes.
